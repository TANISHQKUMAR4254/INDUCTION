The first day of my college life began with a peaceful and spiritual start. We attended a Shabad Kirtan at Guru Sahib, and it really set a calm and positive tone for the day. After that, we were treated to a tea party where we casually interacted with other freshers and began getting comfortable in this new environment.

Next, we all headed to the auditorium for the inaugural ceremony. The event was hosted by Tarnveer Kaur, who kept the flow going smoothly. Harsimran ma'am then gave us a short but informative talk about the college’s background and achievements over the years. One of the former professors also spoke and shared some really thoughtful quotes that left a mark on many of us.

The chief guest, Mahesh Inder Singh, gave a heartfelt speech. He shared some personal memories related to the college and even mentioned his older brother who had completed his B.Tech from here. Our principal then addressed us, speaking with a lot of warmth and encouraging us to make the most of our time here. He emphasized the importance of feeling at home in a new place, which was comforting to hear.

After a short break, we were guided to our respective departments based on our chosen branches. It was great to see the campus more closely and meet some of the faculty. That marked the end of Day 1.
# Day-2
## Date - 1 August , 2025
Today was my second day at college, and it was full of exciting events and insightful lectures. The day began with an expert lecture by Dr. Priya Darshani on universal human values. She emphasized how our efforts can lead to happiness and prosperity, distinguishing between physical facilities and true understanding. 

Then came a pleasant surprise—a presentation about the Satya Scholarship. It was great to learn about the opportunity, and they guided us step-by-step on how to register for it. It's exciting to see such support for students right from the start.

Next up was Dr. Arvind Dhingra, the director of STEP and in-charge of TAC, who delivered an inspiring lecture. He shared valuable insights and advice, which left a lasting impression on us all.

After a short break, we had two subject tests—one in English and another in Maths. It was a bit challenging, but a good way to assess our understanding early on. The day wrapped up with a sense of accomplishment and anticipation for what's to come in this journey at college.
