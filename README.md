The first day of my college life began with a peaceful and spiritual start. We attended a Shabad Kirtan at Guru Sahib, and it really set a calm and positive tone for the day. After that, we were treated to a tea party where we casually interacted with other freshers and began getting comfortable in this new environment.

Next, we all headed to the auditorium for the inaugural ceremony. The event was hosted by Tarnveer Kaur, who kept the flow going smoothly. Harsimran ma'am then gave us a short but informative talk about the college’s background and achievements over the years. One of the former professors also spoke and shared some really thoughtful quotes that left a mark on many of us.

The chief guest, Mahesh Inder Singh, gave a heartfelt speech. He shared some personal memories related to the college and even mentioned his older brother who had completed his B.Tech from here. Our principal then addressed us, speaking with a lot of warmth and encouraging us to make the most of our time here. He emphasized the importance of feeling at home in a new place, which was comforting to hear.

After a short break, we were guided to our respective departments based on our chosen branches. It was great to see the campus more closely and meet some of the faculty. That marked the end of Day 1.
# Day-2
## Date - 1 August , 2025
Today was my second day at college, and it was full of exciting events and insightful lectures. The day began with an expert lecture by Dr. Priya Darshani on universal human values. She emphasized how our efforts can lead to happiness and prosperity, distinguishing between physical facilities and true understanding. 

Then came a pleasant surprise—a presentation about the Satya Scholarship. It was great to learn about the opportunity, and they guided us step-by-step on how to register for it. It's exciting to see such support for students right from the start.

Next up was Dr. Arvind Dhingra, the director of STEP and in-charge of TAC, who delivered an inspiring lecture. He shared valuable insights and advice, which left a lasting impression on us all.

After a short break, we had two subject tests—one in English and another in Maths. It was a bit challenging, but a good way to assess our understanding early on. The day wrapped up with a sense of accomplishment and anticipation for what's to come in this journey at college.
# Day-3
## Date - 4 august , 2025
The third day of college started with a session by the Causmic Club in the auditorium. We were told that this club was formed in 2025 mainly to organise various college events and activities. They also gave us a brief tutorial on how to create a GitHub account and how to upload our projects there, which was something new and interesting for many of us.

After that, we had another session on Human Resource Values by Dr. Priya Darshani ma'am. She continued from where she left off earlier, going deeper into the topic. While it was informative, the session was quite long, and to be honest, some students started feeling a little bored.

Post break, we had our first proper subject-wise lectures. The first one was English by Prof. Nisha. It was really engaging—everyone got a chance to introduce themselves, and she also explained a few grammar tips that are important for speaking confidently. It felt nice to have such an interactive class.

The final lecture of the day was a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) session, where our seniors taught us some basics of the C++ programming language. They even gave us code snippets to try out on our laptops using a compiler, which made the session hands-on and practical. And with that, our third day at college came to an end!
