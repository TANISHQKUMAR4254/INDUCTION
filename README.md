# Induction- Day1
The first day of my college life began with a peaceful and spiritual start. We attended a Shabad Kirtan at Guru Sahib, and it really set a calm and positive tone for the day. After that, we were treated to a tea party where we casually interacted with other freshers and began getting comfortable in this new environment.

Next, we all headed to the auditorium for the inaugural ceremony. The event was hosted by Tarvleen Kaur, who kept the flow going smoothly. Harsimran ma'am then gave us a short but informative talk about the collegeâ€™s background and achievements over the years. One of the former professors also spoke and shared some really thoughtful quotes that left a mark on many of us.

The chief guest, Mahesh Inder Singh, gave a heartfelt speech. He shared some personal memories related to the college and even mentioned his older brother who had completed his B.Tech from here. Our principal then addressed us, speaking with a lot of warmth and encouraging us to make the most of our time here. He emphasized the importance of feeling at home in a new place, which was comforting to hear.

After a short break, we were guided to our respective departments based on our chosen branches. It was great to see the campus more closely and meet some of the faculty. That marked the end of Day 1.
